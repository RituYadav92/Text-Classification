# General

Sectioning closely resembles what Alex said in last meeting; which was to basically follow along the initial steps as described in topic proposal (also see summary in the GitHub wiki, [here](https://github.com/rngShard/ML1_Team02/wiki).

# Building with Latexmk

To build using latexmk, use `latexmk -bibtex -pdf document.tex`. Cleaning afterwards for new build may involve using something like `latexmk -c && rm document.bbl`.
