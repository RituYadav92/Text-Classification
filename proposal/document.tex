\section{Introduction}

The modern world of social media knows a plethora of means to communicate ones personal opinion and political alignment. With the platform \textit{Twitter}, figures of political interest are expressing their standpoints in small-sized 144-character texts, which contain a comprised message specific to the general public. This yields great potential for automated analysis of party affiliations to classify political persons of interest within the overall political spectrum \cite{Biessmann2017}.

Hence do we motivate the structured approach of building a \textbf{social media dataset}, utilizing \textbf{word embeddings} \cite{Pelevinala2016} based modeling approaches to prepare further \textbf{qualitative analysis} to obtain dedicated insight and validate possible early intuition.
This is to be seen in context of latest \textbf{advances in research}.


\section{Data assets}

According to the presented task description of analyzing political affiliation based on Twitter-data, the final comparison occurs on the basis of \textbf{tweets} made by political figures on the platform Twitter.

Additionally, categorized data taken from "www.wahl.de/politiker" is leveraged as a prearrangement of the initial raw Twitter-data.
