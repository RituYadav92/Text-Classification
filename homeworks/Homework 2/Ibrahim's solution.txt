Proposition: If A does not have an infinite number of distinct eigenvectors then each eigenvector
must have a distinct eigenvalue.

Proof: For any vector x to be eigenvector for A ∈ R n×n it has to satisfy the following relation λx =
Ax, where λ is the eigenvalue associated with x.

Since (λx = Ax) is a linear equation, and by definition of eigenvector x ≠ 0, then there exists only
one solution for the eigenvector λ, which implies that each distinct eigenvector will have a distinct
eigenvalue. (1)

From (1), and given that A has a finite set of distinct eigenvectors {V 1 ,V 2 ,.....,V n} , It follows that
for each distinct eigenvector V i it has a distinct eigenvalue λ i.
