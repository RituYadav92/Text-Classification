Proposition: If A does not have an infinite number of distinct eigenvectors then each eigenvector must have a distinct eigenvalue.

Proof : For any vector x to be eigenvector for A ∈ R n×n it has to satisfy the following relation λx = Ax, where λ is the eigenvalue associated with x.

Since (λx = Ax) is a linear equation, and by definition of eigenvector x ≠ 0, then there exists only one solution for the eigenvector λ, which implies that each distinct eigenvector will have a distinct  eigenvalue.  (1)

From (1), and given that A has a finite set of distinct eigenvectors {V1,V2,…..,Vn}, It follows that for each distinct eigenvector Vi it has a distinct eigenvalue λi.


Another Proof: Given that A ∈ R n×n  has a finite set of distinct eigenvectors {V1,V2,…..,Vn}.

Assume that Vi, and Vj (i  ≠  j) have the same eigenvalue  λ, it follows that  λVi = AVi (1)  and λVj = AVj  (2).

For (1), and (2) to be true Vi must be equal to Vj, and since the eigenvectors of A are distinct, it follows that by contradiction no two eigenvectors of A has the same eigenvalue.
